# NCSA PyTorch Tutorial

Deep Learning has revolutionized AI architectures and it is vital to learn the tools to build these models! The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) provides training to all students to learn the tools to build AI algorithms in an HPC environment and this notebook gives a rigorous introduction to PyTorch. Through this notebook we will cover:
- PyTorch Basics
    - Tensors
    - AutoGrad
- Linear Regression via Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Image Classification via Fully Connected Neural Network
- Image Classification via Convolutional Neural Network
- Autoencoders for Image Compression
